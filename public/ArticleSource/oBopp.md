This is a very condensed summary - for more details, please
visit the Devpost post [here](https://devpost.com/software/obopp).

oBopp is a web application aiming to reduce e-waste by turning old
electronics into home security cameras using SocketIO, as well as
intruder detection via Tensorflow. The application was built using
a MERN stack.
