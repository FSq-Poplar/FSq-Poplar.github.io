# UI/UX Is Hard

I'm really bad at design.

This shouldn't be a surprise, given my focus on backend/infra
and complete lack of artistic sense in anything visual.
So when it came time to finally fix the visual atrocity
that was the previous iteration of this portfolio, I had
three key design principles:

1. Minimalism is fine

    Maybe not quite to the to the level of
    [motherfuckingwebsite](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/),
    but animations, fades etc. that get in the way of
    functionality are, contrary to student Poplar's beliefs,
    pretty awful ways of demonstrating ability (or lack
    thereof) in web development and quite unnecessary.

2. Automate and standardize

    The way the majority of pages are created and rendered is
    through conversion of a source markdown file, meaning
    adding any new content is relatively trivial and I
    heavily reduce the amount of web code I have to deal with.

3. Focus on content

    This is pretty heavily related to the first point, but
    one of the goals was to have a design simple enough that
    mobile browsers' reader modes would trigger and content
    would always be at the forefront.

Hopefully these have resulted in a better looking website;
if not, I'm always happy to get constructive feedback.
After all, being slightly bad at something is always
better than being bad at it.
