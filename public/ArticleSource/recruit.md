# Recruit

## Software Engineering

I'm not looking to change jobs at this moment in time, and thus
am not interested in any new opportunities in this regard.
However, I'm always open to hear about interesting side projects
that are looking for a developer.

My focus is on backend and infra. I've written server-side code
and APIs using a variety of protocols ranging from industry standards such
as HTTP and WebSockets, to completely custom solutions. Likewise, I've
worked with different API architectures including REST, RPC and GraphQL.

I have limited sysadmin experience as well, and some basic Cisco
networking certifications. Most of my experience in these areas is
from tinkering on my home server, however - there are a couple
spiels on this topic under [my stuff](/#/stuff).

### Work Experience

I'm currently a Software Engineer at Meta, working on an infra team
under Reality Labs.

In the summer of 2021, I interned at Amazon Web Services. My team was
building new functionality for Connect, in the form of ML powered automatic
employee shift scheduling. My work involved designing the data models and
writing the various APIs for Agent and Staffing Group level rules, which act
as constraints for schedule generation. You can read more about scheduling
and other functionality that was added
[here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/optimization/).

Prior to that, I was a co-op student at the Government of Canada, where
I worked on a couple different projects. On the development side of things,
I modified an internal protocol analysis Android application to allow the
existing business logic to be re-used on other platforms; a simple
CLI version was completed before I left as a proof of concept.

### FSq

FSq is just a random name a group of friends and I who often work on
side projects together use. All of our public projects can be found on
GitHub [here](https://github.com/FSqDev). At the moment only some old
Hackathon projects are public, but we will be releasing more in the future.

Within FSq, my primary roles are backend and deployment. For Hackathons,
the usual web frameworks of choice were a mix of Flask, FastAPI and Express.js
due to their ease of use and quick prototyping, with MongoDB as the NoSQL DB
of choice for similar reasons. For recent projects with more reasonable
timeframes, we have been looking into Golang for concurrency and the ever
apparent limitations of Python as an interpreted language. I strongly believe
that Golang should replace Python outside of academia.

Similar to web frameworks, our deployments and CI/CD pipelines were more or
less set in stone for Hackathons due to time constraints - Heroku and GitHub
Actions provide powerful yet simple to use and fast solutions to these problems.
Thankfully, both still fit our use case very well for more general use; the
exception is testing/beta environments as Heroku is shutting down its free tier.
To remedy this, we have been experimenting with building Docker images using
GitHub Actions and pulling down the artifacts to an old X99 Xeon server via a
simple Cron job.

## Music

I'm looking to join a volunteer orchestra here in the Bay Area as a
violinist sometime in the near future - if you have any opportunities
of this type, please feel free to contact me :)

### Instrumental

I received my Associate Diploma in Piano Performance (ARCT) from
the Royal Conservatory of Music in 2015 before pausing to focus on
school. Having finished university, I am now working towards a Licentiate.

In terms of orchestral music, I played in the Edmonton Youth Orchestra
from 2013 to 2018 as a violinist, ending up as a first violin in the senior
orchestra.

I also was briefly a member of the University of Toronto Philharmonic
Orchestra, but unfortunately was unable to continue as it did not fit
my class schedule at the time.

### Production and Arrangements

I played around with Ableton quite a bit in university, but ultimately
did not have the time to complete anything I was comfortable releasing
publicly. Now that I have more time on my hands, I hope to finish up
some projects and piano arrangements that have been untouched for longer
than I'd like to admit.

If you have any production projects which could benefit from having
a classically trained musician on the team, please feel free to reach out!
