# poBop

This is a very condensed summary - for more details, please
visit the Devpost post [here](https://devpost.com/software/pobop).

poBop is an android application which aims to reduce food waste
by monitoring expiry dates, as well as suggesting recipes that
make use of soon-to-expire ingredients. The app was made with
native android, and the server was built with Flask.
