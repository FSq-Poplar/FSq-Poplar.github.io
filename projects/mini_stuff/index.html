	<p><em>Storage Visualizer </em><a href="https://github.com/FSq-Poplar/storage_visualizer">(GitHub Repo)</a></p>

	<p>This was actually made from a school assignment in which we made a storage visualizer to practice working with trees. I needed to find ogg music files in a game folder, and ended up adding the file type colorization to the assignment to find their directory; later I rebuilt it from scratch and this tool took shape.</p>

	<center></p></figure>

	<p>It creates a tree-like data structure containing all the relevant information to render, such as color, location, size etc - the "FileSystemTree" class. While definitely not the most efficient way to do it, as previously mentioned a large part of this assignment was to practice working with the data structure. To that end, I kept that design choice from the original assignment.</p>

	<p><em>Binder Sleeper Laptop</em></p>

	<p>An old netbook of mine had its case crack, to the point where it wasn't really portable anymore unless I wanted to break the thing in half. Fortunately, it was still functional as a computer and I ended up taking the thing out of its chassis.</p>

	<p>I remembered seeing pentesting kits built into makeup kits, and had the idea to build the laptop into a binder I had lying around. After buying a bluetooth keyboard/trackpad, it only took a few hours to put together this sleeper laptop.</p>
