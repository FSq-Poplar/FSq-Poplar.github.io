I'm by no means an expert on the topic, and would highly recommend <a href='http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html'><em>this book</em></a> to anyone looking to learn the basics of machine learning. Without going into the details, the plan seemed fairly simple from the start; each component and level of the network, be it a neuron or layer, as well as any mathematical operations not built into Verilog, would have a corresponding module written. The network's setup would be determined by a Python script and training would be done by loading the MNIST dataset. Having a sufficient understanding of the topic already, our first schematics were drawn up fairly quickly.</p>\n        <Figure\n          source='./Resources/Projects/FPGANN/proud_wentao.jpg'\n          title='Network Schematic'\n          caption='A proud Wentao stands in front of the first schematic iteration.'\n        />\n        <p>Of course, things didn't go as smoothly as expected.\n          <br />I should start off by saying the problems we ran into were rarely machine learning related; a simple neural network can reach 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset with <a href='https://github.com/FSq-Poplar/FPGA_NN/blob/master/python_simulation/network.py'><em>a bit over 100 lines of code</em></a> in a high level language, and is relatively rudimentary. Rather, the majority of our problems arose from Verilog's limitations (especially when compared to its modern counterpart SystemVerilog), and the 5CSEMA5F31C6 chip we had available to us.\n          <br />Lets start off with the obvious - the board. While the DE1-SoC is a great board for teaching the basics of computer organization and FPGA development, it proved quite lacking for a project of this scale. The first problem we encountered was that the size of the chip did not allow for a network with back-propogation, much to our disappointment. We were forced to instead load weights and biases from the aforementioned Python script and implement only the feed-forward portion of the network on the actual FPGA.\n        </p>\n        <Figure\n          source='./Resources/Projects/FPGANN/de1soc.png'\n          title='DE1-SoC Board'\n          caption='The Terasic DE1-SoC board used by UofT'\n        />\n        <p>To make matters worse, the board was also quite lacking in memory; as the number of weights and biases grows exponentially with layers, these values had to be loaded onto the board's RAM instead of registers directly on the chip. While this isn't a major issue in terms of difficulty, it did complicate the design and timing of the network considerably, which cost a lot of development time.\n          <br />Board limitations were brought up as a possibility beforehand. Unfortunately, we were completely unprepared for the restrictions Verilog '05 would lay down. There were several small things here and there, my personal favourite being the <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40010554/how-do-i-initialize-a-2-dimensional-parameter-array-in-verilog-2005?rq=1'><em>lack of support for two-dimensional arrays</em></a>. It wasn't uncommon to write Python scripts to write repetitive Verilog code, which is as horrifying as it sounds.\n        </p>\n        <Figure\n          source='./Resources/Projects/FPGANN/beautiful_verilog.png'\n          title='Awful Verilog Code'\n          caption=\"There were ways to jury-rig Verilog, but it wasn't pretty.\"\n        />\n        <p>But the biggest issue was the lack of floats. In short, Verilog 2005's built-in real data type is completely unusable for this project, as they do not support the mathematical operations required. Integers were workable, asides from the fact that rounding that much would make the neural network beyond worthless (thanks to our use of the <a href='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SigmoidFunction.html'><em>Sigmoid function</em></a>). This meant that we were forced to create a new number representation in Verilog, as well as all of its corresponding operations; everything from hadamard products to basic addition.\n          <br />Our final solution was to represent floats with 32-digit integers as \"binary\" instead, and write all the necessary operations from there. This was a very crude way to represent doubles in the language, but was the only solution that we were able to implement given our deadlines. While it works, its not very memory efficient and definitely a pain for humans to read.\n        </p>\n        <Figure\n          source='./Resources/Projects/FPGANN/modelsim_binary.png'\n          title='Awful ModelSim Testing'\n          caption='ModelSim testing was a nightmare of its own.'\n        />\n        <p>The UI of the project also presented a few minor problems, mostly resulting from the same language restrictions encountered in the other parts of the project, as well as some new ones (such as converting <a href='https://github.com/Nananas/ImageToMif'><em>png to mif</em></a>). The best example of \"Verilog should support this but doesn't\" was the lack of a modulo function, which made converting cursor position to a square on the 14x14 grid (on which users \"wrote\" their number) much more difficult than it should've been.\n          <br />I've been pretty hard on Verilog 2005, but in all fairness many of these so called restrictions make much more sense once placed in the context of a hardware description language, as opposed to a high level language like C or Python. While SystemVerilog would've made this project much simpler, at the end of the day many of these issues are just direct results of working with hardware.\n        </p>\n        <Figure\n          source='./Resources/Projects/FPGANN/unique_test.jpg'\n          title='Peculiar Test Case'\n          caption='A test done by an onlooker in Bahen (network predicted: 1)'\n        />\n        <p>With everything said, we were ultimately able to get the neural network up and running, albeit with a few compromises. I'd like to thank my partner, Wentao, for powering through countless all-nighters and teaching me the basics of machine learning. I'd also like to thank our professor, Rabia Bakhteri, for her guidance and support throughout the development period.\n          <br />The source code for the project can be found <a href='https://github.com/FSq-Poplar/FPGA_NN'><em>on my GitHub here</em></a>.

Due to the difficulty and boilerplate associated with the Canvas API, visualization libraries which use Canvas are relatively locked down in terms of appearance, with users being forced to pick presets.</p>\n\n        <p>Thus, even a simple single direction WaveForm.JS object can be configured to be lines, moving points, or bars however simple (background-color only) or complex (even background-image) as preferred, compared to their restrictive Canvas counterparts. Such examples can be seen on the <a href='https://fsq-poplar.com/WaveFormJS/examples/'><em>examples</em></a> page.</p>\n\n        <Figure\n          source='./Resources/Projects/WaveFormJS/continuous_visual.png'\n          title='Continuous Visualization, Wave.js'\n          caption='Continuous Visualizations, unsupported by WaveForm.js'\n        />\n\n        <p>Unfortunately, the use of divs inherently places an upper limit on the number of visualization points. Hence, more \"continuous\" visualizations such as the one above from Wave.js, cannot be practically made using WaveForm.js; the performance overhead from rendering so many objects in the DOM would be too much.</p>\n\n        <p>On the topic of performance, the DOM and CSS are optimized for rectangular objects, well aligned along a two dimensional plane. For more complex shapes such as circles, visualizations using Divs would require both considerable amounts of processing to determine positioning, as well as significant DOM manipulation to position them; a code example can be seen below.</p>\n\n        <Figure\n          source='./Resources/Projects/WaveFormJS/circle_pos_calc.png'\n          title='Code snippet of circular positional calculations'\n          caption='Code snippet of positional calculations for Circular objects'\n        />\n\n        <p>Ultimately, and quite surprisingly, this additional processing overhead amounts to very little; most modern computers can run this level of computation with ease, and the overhead of manipulating DOM elements in the way WaveForm.JS does is negligible compared to more modern web libraries and frameworks, such as React or Angular - this can be confirmed with any resource monitoring tool or library.</p>\n\n        <p>With all this in mind, I personally believe that for discrete visualizations, Divs are by far the more user friendly in the context of a user-friendly and highly customizable audio visualization library. Thus, as no other libraries did this, I created and released WaveFormJS so others could see pictures of Nicholas Cage stretching up and down in sync with their favourite music.</p>\n\n        <p>What?</p>\n\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport '../index.css'\n\nimport Header from '../Components/Header'\nimport Footer from '../Components/Footer'\nimport Figure from '../Components/Figure'\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom'\n\nexport default class MiniProjects extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <div className='Builds'>\n        <Header\n          title='mini_stuff: '\n          text='Quick Projects from a Bored CS Student'\n        />\n        <p className='prompt'><Link to='/'><i className='pulsate'>./home?</i></Link></p>\n        <p className='prompt'>echo '&lt; mini_stuff_blog.txt'</p>\n\n        <p>A couple of interesting smaller things I've worked on which didn't fall under or deserve their own tiles on the main page.</p>\n        <br />\n\n        <p><em>Daily Driver Desktop </em><a href='https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/fLmXTC'>(PCPartPicker List)</a></p>\n        <p>My custom built PC.
